To build the tool you need to have:
 * A C# compiler that supports .NET 4.0
 * .NET Framework 4.0
 
Open the Solution (\Modelica_ResultCompare.sln) in Visual Studio,
build the Project in the desired configuration (Debug|Release)
and run the "compare.exe" in the output dir.

To automatically build the project use the "\deliver\create.bat"
this is going to create a directory containing the compare.exe and
the documents (i.e. \deliver\1.0.0.123".
